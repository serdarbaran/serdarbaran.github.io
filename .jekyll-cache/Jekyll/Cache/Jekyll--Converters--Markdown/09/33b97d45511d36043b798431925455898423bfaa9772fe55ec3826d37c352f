I"p<!-- Hi! I am Serdar, web designer & developer at WowThemes.net. The free items I create are my side projects and **Mundana for Jekyll** is one of them. You can find **all the work I release for free [here](https://www.wowthemes.net/category/free-themes-templates/)**.  -->

<p>You have my permission to use the free items I develop in your personal, commercial or client projects. If youâ€™d like to reward my work, I would be honored and I could dedicate more time maintaining the free projects.</p>

<p>Thank you so much!</p>
