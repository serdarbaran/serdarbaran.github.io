I"∑<p>Kali Linux distribution is highly customizable. It, by default, probably doesn‚Äôt have everything you need to get you through day-to-day use with ease. 
There are just many things can be done improve your interaction with the operating system depends on how you feel comfortable to use it.</p>

<p>However, with a few changes in the settings, and applications, you can quickly get started using Kali like a professional white hat.</p>

<h3 id="1--create-a-new-low-privileged-user">1- Create a New Low Privileged User</h3>
<p>Creating a new low privileged user goes top in my list. Let‚Äôs get one of the most important thing right in the first place.
It is strongly advised to open many applications like the Chromium Browser and the Tor Browser with low privileged user. Such applications rely heavily upon low-level permissions to deliver some degree of security.</p>

<p>For years now, Kali distributed by default with root user. Recently Kali moved to a ‚Äútraditional default non-root user‚Äù model. However if you are using root user, moving to non-root user is suggested to reduce a security risk which make the host to be compromised more difficult.</p>

<p>You can ass a new user by user the following command;</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo adduser newuser
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It will ask user password and some extra information before completing the process. 
Note: By default, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password. This is the user‚Äôs password, not the root password itself.

<p>You should double check if the new user is added successfully by</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ awk -F: '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/12.png" alt="check_add_new_user" /></p>

<h3 id="2--update-upgrade--dist-upgrade">2- Update, Upgrade, &amp; Dist-Upgrade</h3>
<p>I assume you downloaded the latest version of Kali. But again it is worth to check you have the latest of everything and update the your workstation‚Äôs dependencies.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get clean 
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y 
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/13.png" alt="apt-get_clean" />
<img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/14.png" alt="apt-get_upgrade" /></p>

<h3 id="3--install-git">3- Install Git</h3>
<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system and commonly used in Linux. 
Git can be installed by using the command below;</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get install git
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/15.png" alt="install_git_on_kali" /></p>

<h3 id="4--customization-of-kali-linuxs-look">4- Customization of Kali Linux‚Äôs Look</h3>
<p>If you would like to tweak on how your Linux‚Äôs Look, I would like to recommend gnome-tweaks tool. This is a desktop customization and setting manager for Gnome desktops.</p>

<h3 id="5--install-tor-browser">5- Install Tor Browser</h3>
<p>The Tor (The Onion Router) provides anonymity and privacy to users. With Tor, you could potentially prevent third party tracing your activity back to your IP address. The traffic that passes along the Tor network is encrypted.</p>

<p>Open a terminal window</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install tor torbrowser-launcher 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and select Y at the prompt
<img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/18.png" alt="install_tor" /></p>

<p>For the first time, it will download some packages
<img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/19.png" alt="install_tor_2" /></p>

<p>Note: If you‚Äôre running Kali Linux as root, you might get an error saying you can‚Äôt run Tor as root. You should switch to less privileged user.</p>

<h3 id="6--install-anti-virus-program">6- Install Anti-Virus Program</h3>
<p>If you a preferred Antivirus Program with a licence, go for it. If you don‚Äôt want to pay and looking for a free program, you might consider checking ClamAV, ClamTk, ChkrootKit and RookKit Hunter,Sophos and F-PROT.</p>

<p>For example ClamAV can be installed:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get install clamav
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/17.png" alt="install_clamav" /></p>

<h3 id="7--install-your-favourite-code-editor">7- Install your favourite code editor</h3>
<p>Two very popular code editor comes to my mind for Linux. One of them is Atom and other one is VS Code. Pick one of them install. I will go for with</p>

<ul>
  <li>First change the directory into your Downloads folder, or wherever you have downloaded the file to.
cd /home/kali/Downloads/</li>
  <li>Secondly to install Atom Linux distribution, add Atom‚Äôs official package repository to your system by running the following commands:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ wget -qO - https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/any/ any main" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/atom.list'
$ sudo apt-get update
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>After that install Atom
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Install Atom
$ sudo apt-get install atom
# Install Atom Beta
$ sudo apt-get install atom-beta
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Alternatively you can install .deb package and install it directly
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Install Atom
$ sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
# Install Atom's dependencies if they are missing
$ sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="8--install-terminal-multiplexer">8- Install Terminal Multiplexer</h3>
<p>Multiplexer terminal emulator divides the window several sub-windows to help you to do many things in one window. There are many multiplexer available free. Probably by now you‚Äôre asking : ‚ÄúOK, I get it, but which one should I use?‚Äù - the answer to that is ‚ÄúThe one that suits you best‚Äù. More of less they all same. It is a program that manages the terminal window is good tool to use in terms of information gathering.</p>

<p>For example you can install one of them is call Tilix by the following command:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get install tilix
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/20.png" alt="install_tilix" /></p>

<hr />
<p>If I haven‚Äôt forgotten anything, those are the Top Things I prefer to do after installing Kali Linux. It is important that you understand that you can be at risk when running your OS as root. It is definitely recomended to use low privilaged for beginners. Keep my recommendations in mind and you have created yourself an extra layer of protection.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, this list is ongoing, so make sure to check back! I look forward hear your things you do first when you install Kali!</p>
