I"Æ"<p>Kali Linux distribution is highly customizable. It, by default, doesn‚Äôt have everything you need to get you through day-to-day use with ease. The various things that can be done to improve your interaction with the operating system depends on how comfortable you feel in using it. With a few changes in the settings and applications, you can quickly get started in using Kali like a professional white hat.</p>

<h3 id="1-create-a-new-low-privileged-user">1. Create a New Low Privileged User</h3>
<p>Creating a new low privileged user goes top on my list. Let‚Äôs get one of the most important things right in the first place. It is strongly advised to open many applications like the Chromium Browser and the Tor Browser with low privileged user. Such applications rely heavily upon low-level permissions to deliver some degree of security.</p>

<p>For many years, Kali was being distributed by default with root user. Recently, Kali moved to a ‚Äútraditional default non-root user‚Äù model. However if you are using root user, moving to non-root user is suggested to mitigate a security risk which make the host to be compromised more difficult.</p>

<p>You can add a new user by using the following command;</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo adduser newuser
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>It will ask user password and some extra information before completing the process. 
Note: By default, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password. This is the user‚Äôs password, not the root password itself.<br />

<p>You should double check if the new user is added successfully by</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ awk -F: '{ print $1}' /etc/passwd
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/12.png" alt="check_add_new_user" /></p>

<h3 id="2-update-upgrade--dist-upgrade">2. Update, Upgrade, &amp; Dist-Upgrade</h3>
<p>I assume you downloaded the latest version of Kali. But again it is worth to check you have the latest of everything and update your workstation‚Äôs dependencies.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get clean 
$ sudo apt-get update 
$ sudo apt-get upgrade -y 
$ sudo apt-get dist-upgrade -y
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/13.png" alt="apt-get_clean" />
<img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/14.png" alt="apt-get_upgrade" /></p>

<h3 id="3-install-git">3. Install Git</h3>
<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system and commonly used in Linux. 
Git can be installed by using the command below;</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get install git
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/15.png" alt="install_git_on_kali" /></p>

<h3 id="4-customization-of-kali-linuxs-look">4. Customization of Kali Linux‚Äôs Look</h3>
<p>If you would like to tweak on how your Linux‚Äôs look, I would like to recommend gnome-tweaks tool. This is a desktop customization and setting manager for Gnome desktops.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get install gnome-tweaks-tool
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/21.png" alt="install_gnome-tweaks" /></p>

<h3 id="5-install-tor-browser">5. Install Tor Browser</h3>
<p>The Tor (The Onion Router) provides anonymity and privacy to users. With Tor, you could potentially prevent third party tracing your activity back to your IP address. The traffic that passes along the Tor network is encrypted.</p>

<p>Open a terminal window</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install tor torbrowser-launcher 
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>and select Y at the prompt
<img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/18.png" alt="install_tor" /></p>

<p>For the first time, it will download some packages
<img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/19.png" alt="install_tor_2" /></p>

<p>‚ö† Note: If you‚Äôre running Kali Linux as root, you might get an error saying you can‚Äôt run Tor as root. You should switch to less privileged user.</p>

<h3 id="6-install-anti-virus-program">6. Install Anti-Virus Program</h3>
<p>If you have a preferred Antivirus Program with a licence, go for it. If you don‚Äôt want to pay and are looking for a free program, you might consider checking ClamAV, ClamTk, ChkrootKit, RookKit Hunter,Sophos and F-PROT.</p>

<p>For example ClamAV can be installed by:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get install clamav
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/17.png" alt="install_clamav" /></p>

<h3 id="7-install-your-favourite-code-editor">7. Install your favourite code editor</h3>
<p>Two very popular code editor comes to my mind for Linux. One of them is Atom and the other one is VS Code. Pick one of them to install. I will go with Atom.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First change the directory into your Downloads folder, or wherever you have downloaded the file to.
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ cd /home/kali/Downloads/
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Secondly to install Atom Linux distribution, add Atom‚Äôs official package repository to your system by running the following commands:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ wget -qO - https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://packagecloud.io/AtomEditor/atom/any/ any main" &gt; /etc/apt/sources.list.d/atom.list'
$ sudo apt-get update
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>After that install Atom
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Install Atom
$ sudo apt-get install atom
# Install Atom Beta
$ sudo apt-get install atom-beta
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Alternatively you can install .deb package and install it directly
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code># Install Atom
$ sudo dpkg -i atom-amd64.deb
# Install Atom's dependencies if they are missing
$ sudo apt-get -f install
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/16.png" alt="install_atom" /></p>

<h3 id="8-install-terminal-multiplexer">8. Install Terminal Multiplexer</h3>
<p>Multiplexer terminal emulator divides the window into several sub-windows to help you do many things in one window. There are many multiplexers available for free. Probably by now you‚Äôre asking : ‚ÄúBut which one should I use?‚Äù - the answer to that is ‚ÄúThe one that suits you best‚Äù. More or less they are all the same. It is a program that manages the terminal window and is a good tool to use in terms of information gathering.</p>

<p>For example you can install one of them called Tilix by the following command:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ sudo apt-get install tilix
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Once the installation is completed, type¬†<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tilix</code>¬†in the command window to run tilix</p>

<p><img src="/serdarbaran.github.io/assets/images/top_things_to_do_Kali/20.png" alt="install_tilix" /></p>

<hr />

<p>Those are the Top Things I prefer to do after installing Kali Linux. These installed packages and settings makes my work on Kali much faster and easier. I would like to remind again that it is important you know you can be at risk when running your OS as root. It is definitely recommended to use low privileged user account for beginners. Keep my recommendations in mind and you will have created yourself an extra layer of protection.</p>

<p>As I mentioned at the beginning of the article, this list is ongoing, so make sure to check back! Feel free to let me know your first to do when you install Kali!</p>
